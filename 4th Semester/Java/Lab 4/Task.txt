Task 1

Suppose, as a programmer of a reknowned software development farm, you are assigned
a task of creating employee records.
The company keeps records of an employees Name, ID, Date of Birth, Email, Address, Contact
Number, Salary. The company also has a policy of how long an employee can serve the company and
the record for each employee contains that information.

Sometimes the company requires information about certain portion of the employees' record, but they have
emphasized on the fact that the funtion to extract those informations will be universal i.e. what ever information
the company requires, the same function should be invoked every time.

The ID of the employee is assigned automatically and sequentially whenever a new employee is appointed.

Your task is to create the above mentioned system with the following highlights:

1. You should implement the concept of package.
2. The company doesn't have very high end servers, so memory and performance is a constraint when you 
    have to keep information of over 100,000 employees. Optimise your system for this issue.
3. the ID assigned to the employee should be sequential. and the person with the latest ID should reflect upon
    the total number of employees currently employed.
4. Finally you have to show an output containing certain portions of employees' record via the same method.
