\subsection{Question: Task 3}
\emph{Write another function OutputSideConvolutionthat uses the Output Side Algorithm.}

\subsection{Theory: Output Side Algorithm}
THe output side algorithm shows how one output signal sample is influenced by many samples of different input signal samples. The general formula followed by the output side algorithm is
\begin{equation}
    y[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{M}{h[j] * s[i - j + 1]}
\end{equation}
Here, y[i] is the i-th sample of output signal, h is the impulse response and s is the input signal.

\subsection{MATLAB Code: outputSideAlgorithm()}
The code listed below convolutes signal s and h using the the output side algorithm:
\lstinputlisting[language=Octave]{./Codes/outputSideAlgorithm.m}

\subsection{Test Run: outputSideAlgorithm()}
The following code snippet runs \emph{outputSideAlgorithm(s, h)}:
