\section{Introduction}
\emph{Kruskal's algorithm} is a \emph{minimum-spanning-tree (MST)} algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. The algorithm was written by \emph{Joseph Kruskal} and published in 1956 at the \emph{Proceedings of American Mathematical Society}.
